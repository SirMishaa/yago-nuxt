## Set up the project

#### ASDF 
At the root of the repository, there is a file called `.tool-versions`. This file contains the version of the tools used in the project. 
You can use [ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com/#/) to install the right version of the tools.

First, install all the required plugins for ASDF:
```bash
cut -d' ' -f1 .tool-versions | xargs -i asdf plugin add  {} 
```
Then, you can do the following command to install all the tools with the right version:
```bash
asdf install
```
After that, install the dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```
You're ready to go! ðŸš€

### Docker
You can also use Docker to run the project. You need to have Docker installed on your machine. 
Then, you can run the following command to build the image:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
All the dependencies will be installed and the project will start automatically! ðŸš€
